# Me & You - Newton Canteen Menu

Flutter app providing a proper web app experience to read the canteen's menu for the Newton building in Munich.

## Architecture

## Future Work

This app does pretty much exactly what I want it to do.
However, some ideas could still be implemented:

- Automatically scroll to current day (this one would actually be pretty nice)
  - Maybe using an approach similar to [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49153087/flutter-scrolling-to-a-widget-in-listview), although I didn't get it to work on the first try
- Update indicator
  - Combination of early notification from state and SliverAppBar with `stretch: true` crashes
- Filters for allergens, veggie, ...
- Feedback, rate dishes
- Favourites
